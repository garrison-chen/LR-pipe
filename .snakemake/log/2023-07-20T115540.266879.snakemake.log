MissingOutputException in rule qc_reporting_minionqc in file /Users/gch21/Desktop/ONT-pipe/Snakefile, line 7:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/gch21/Desktop/ONT-pipe/test_results/Results/minion_qc_results
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
